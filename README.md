# Advent-of-Code-2022

My answers for the Advent-of-Code 2022. First time doing it will try to be consistent and do it all.  
It's also my first time using Deno, so this will be fun :smile:

To run the different files you need to have Deno installed and run one of the following commands:

    // Run this command for one time use, will ask your for permissions if needed
    deno run 'fileName'
    // Run this command for development, will bypass permissions asking and use a watcher
    deno run --allow-all --watch 'fileName'
